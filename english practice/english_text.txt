I’ve been feeling stressed out lately. The pressure at work has been intense, with tight deadlines and high expectations. I’ve been working long hours and feeling like I’m constantly under pressure to perform. On top of that, I’ve had a lot of personal stuff going on, and it’s left me feeling overwhelmed and on edge.I feel like I’m in a tight spot and unsure how to get out of it. I find myself snapping at people more easily and having a hard time sleeping at night. I’m trying to take breaks and find ways to relax, but it’s hard when there is so much on my plate. I must find a way to de-stress and return to feeling like myself again.
